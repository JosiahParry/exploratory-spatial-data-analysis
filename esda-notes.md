## EDA 

- EDA created by John Tukey
- Spatial analysis lacks locational invariance 
- EDA is non-scientific it relies on interaction and judgement on the side of the analyst to "discover potentially explicable patterns" (Good, 1983)
  - the explanation of the patterns is not part of the EDA process.
  - The EDA process is about identfying those observations or groups of observations, or patterns that may have a good question behind it and can be answered
- EDA is about designing new views of the data that suggest interesting patterns or elicit interesting questions 
- eda explores distributions of data 

## ESDA 

- EDA + spatially specific topics
- most noteably the spatial distribution 
  - are things randomly distributed 
  - or are they sytematically located on place more than another 
- an outlier in space is not the same as that of the traditional concept. 
  - a spatial outlier is different from its neighbors, not from the entirety of the dataset 
- spatial autocorrelation: how similar things are in similar locations
- spatial heterogeneity: identify spatial differences perhaps identifying multiple distributions
  - spatial regimes: spatial subsets of the data where different models or statistics may have to be applied

"Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) is an extension of exploratory data analysis as it explicitly focuses on the particular characteristics of geographical data. "

"spatial distributions, identify atypical locations or spatial outliers, discover patterns of spatial association, clusters or hot spots, and suggest spatial regimes or other forms of spatial heterogeneity."

# potential outline

- me very briefly
- brief review of EDA
  - goal
  - techniques
- ESDA is an extension of EDA looking at spatial patterns
- first need to understand what spatial data might mean
  - you might have an intuition and its likely correct
  - spatial data is any data that is tied or can be tied to a physical location
    - on the globe, in space, or in some other plane
  - lets think of the data generation proces
    - satellite imagery
    - transit (bus routes, road networks)
    - regions e.g. census tracts
    - locations of trees
    - building locations
  - most data that is generated in the era of big data is actually spatial in nature
    - sales transactions
    - 311 & 911 calls 
    - mobile data (ever wonder why so many apps need your location)
    - map routing
    - vehicles
- types of spatial data
  - spatial data generally falls into two separate buckets
    1. vector (the focus of this talk and most ESDA) 
    2. raster
  - vector:
    - the basic unit of vector data is the point determined by an X, Y (and sometimes Z) coordinate
    - lines are the connections to two or more points
    - polygons are the connections of 4 points or more (3 verticies or more)
      - polygons are closed so thus the last point lands on the first point to close it  - examples:
      - traffic incident locations
      - road networks
      - census tracts, or zoning regions
  - raster data
    - represented by a grid where each cell (pixel) contains a value 
    - examples:
      - sattelite imagery
      - land cover
      - remote sensing data (LiDAR)
        - autonoumous vehicles, face id 
      - weather patterns
      - much much more
- for the purpose of this talk we'll focus on vector data and specifically points and polygons
- ESDA cont. 
  - ESDA, rather than EDA, rather than comparing a part to the whole compares a part its neighbors
    - outliers in the case of ESDA aren't extreme values compared to the entire dataset or groups in the data set, but outliers in comparison to one's spatial neighbors
  - Goals:
    - the same as EDA: discover potentially explicable patterns
      - identifying hotspots
      - identifying potential spatial regimes
  - techniques:
    - spatial autocorrelation
    - local indicators of spatial association
- Understanding spatial neighbors
  - Goal: identify the neighbors for each region in our dataset
  - For polygons, neighbors are defined by the other polygons that it touches (or are contiguous with)
  - Two primary types of contiguity:
    - Edge (rook)
    - Vertices (queen)
- Understanding Spatial Weights
- Understanding the spatial lag
  - warning! We're going to get a LITTLE mathy here but i'm sure you all got it 
    - only going to be adding, subtracting, and taking averages! 
  - if you're familiar with time-series, the idea is similar
    - with time-series the lag compares an obverserved value compared to the same observed value at an earlier point in time
  - with spatial analysis, we compare an observed point with the observed point of its neighbors
  - the spatial lag is simply the expected value (average) of a variable in a neighborhood excluding the observed regions value 
  - with the computed spatial lag, we can visually compare an observed regions value to the average value of its neighbors (the spatial lag) using a scatter plot
  - x: the observed value
  - y: the spatial lag
  - we use this plot to explore whether or not 
- Understanding Spatial autocorrelation
  - spatial randomness
  - negative autocorrelation
  - positive spatial autocorrelation
  - generally bounded between [-1, 1] though in some cases can exceed. 
- Hypothesis testing in space
  - null: spatial randomness
  - alternative: not-spatially random
  - most variables do not fall under our assumption of normality so normal t-tests do not suffice
  - we use permutation based hypothesis testing to create _simulated_ p-values
- The Global Moran
- The Local Moran
- Introduction to sfdep
  - background: grad school learning these topics with Geoff Boeing using Pysal--the most common open-source tool for ESDA. The whole time was a little miffed I couldn't easily do this in R
    - show his chart of average street network direction
  - extension of the library `spdep` 
  - motivation: make spdep tidyverse compatible, work exclusively with sf objects, and make ESDA as accessible, if not more accessible than pysal
  - outputs are meant to be tidyverse compatible as possible:
    - vectors, lists, and data frames
      - vectors as columns
      - lists as list columns
      - data frames that can be unnested or unpacked as new columns
      
- Making neighbors
- Making spatial weights
- Making the spatial lag
- Making a moran plot
- The Global Moran's I
- Making Moran's I local
  - intuition
  - example visualization
